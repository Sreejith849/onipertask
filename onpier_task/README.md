## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).


## About Task

Download and install Java, Chromedriver and VS Code on your local machine

Clone the repo and navigate to qaautomation/tests/thgPramieTestCase.java to run the automation script. Please be noted and you will be needed to specify the path of the file that needs to be uploaded. You can simply replace <FILD-PATH> from upload method called "uploadFilePageShouldBeLoaded" which is in payment_page.java file
